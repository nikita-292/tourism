        <h2>About Bhojpur Temple</h2>
        <p>
            Bhojpur Temple, located near Bhopal, is a renowned Hindu temple dedicated to Lord Shiva. The temple is
            situated on the banks of the Betwa River and is known for its historical and architectural significance. It
            stands as a testament to the rich cultural and religious heritage of the region.
        </p>

        <p>
            The temple is believed to have been commissioned by the legendary Parmara King, Raja Bhoja, in the 11th
            century. However, the construction of the temple remains incomplete, making it a unique and intriguing

        <h2>History of Bhojpur Temple</h2>
        <p>
            Bhojpur Temple is named after Raja Bhoja, who was a patron of art, culture, and architecture. According to
            historical accounts, the construction of the temple was halted due to unknown reasons, possibly including a
            scarcity of funds or a change in the political scenario during that time.
        </p>

        <p>
            The temple is particularly famous for the colossal Shiva Lingam installed inside. This Lingam, made of a
            single stone, is considered one of the largest in India. Despite the incomplete structure, the temple
            attracts devotees and tourists alike who come to witness its unique architectural features and pay homage to
            Lord Shiva.
